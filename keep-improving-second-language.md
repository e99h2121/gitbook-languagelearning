#Keep improving

After go back to the home country, how can we keep its motivation of learning language. And the practical way.



## In my case

Now I eager to keep my English skills so much. The reason is:

- It was one of the hugest my experience to work and live in overseas during 3 years. Even after coming back to my home town, I'd like to communicate with every friend and teammate as the bridge. In order to be, English is the fundamental.

- It is the essential tool to get the resource of the latest news and information, to survibe in Tech field. 

- And in my experience to live in Shanghai, to talk with a lot of kind of country's people, it was completely amazing moment for me. And I found in that moment to speak English is very basic requirement to be a good friend. Simply, I'm always curious about why they came to China, and why they are in China? China is not so comfortable in fact, but what is the attraction of them? My curiosity toward every friend is not satisfied without using any language. 

- So, even I go back to my home, I'd like to keep getting motivated and want to be more good communicator.
