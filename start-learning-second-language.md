Why I needed to learn. The background, and my experience.








#My original motivation toward studying language during working in overseas

There may be several kind of the phases.

There is very understandable chart in web-page, so I'd like to quote it first. -> [2013年itエンジニアは英語を学ぶべきか](http://qa-it.tumblr.com/post/40077096207/2013%E5%B9%B4it%E3%82%A8%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B8%E3%83%8B%E3%82%A2%E3%81%AF%E8%8B%B1%E8%AA%9E%E3%82%92%E5%AD%A6%E3%81%B6%E3%81%B9%E3%81%8D%E3%81%8B)

## In my case

The blog which is mentioned is written in 2013, so it means same year with my transferring my work from Tokyo to Shanghai. 

Original purpose is very clear. Because I decided to transfer overseas office to be a transferrer from Japan. Just want to communicate more effectively, and smoothly. 

To enjoy the conversation with others. And to get the advantage from the skill. I have worked 10 years as build-up software engineer in Tokyo. So, it was quite attractive chance to me to go to overseas as a software engineer. 

Finally, to keep maintaining as the requirement who experienced to live in overseas. And I decide to keep improving.


###Reading

Basically, this is already trained if you graduated university in Japan. And relatively many Japanese also has better skill on this point. So, simply we need to do is to increase its vocabulary well. 

The key of practice will be when you find some unknown word for you, you should not skip to check it by dictionary. Even if you can guess the meaning. And hopefully we should write down on your personal memo, and repeat to remember it during the day. Then your remembrance become stable and you can acquire as your own new vocabulary. 


###Listening

This is very easy to try if you have a some mp3 player or devices. But, important thing is not just to listen as the sound, but you need to comprehend about the topics and to be repeat it. Or to say some your own opinion about it.

In this part also we should not skip to study new word if you find unknown word which is hard to recognize. 


###Writing

Writing required 2 steps for me. The very beginning steps was to write Japanese sentence first. And secondly translate it in English by using dictionary. It was done by mainly by using google translate. 
Actually I think this first step is not effective way. Because the process is completely separated, and it is different from the real situation of the talking. When we want to improve the speaking skill with the same time, this method cannot be applied direct;y. 

Then, here is the second step. It is completely same as Japanese writing, by thinking English sentence first, to write down it directory. It requires basic productive skill of the language but this is more natural to improve my skill well. 


###Speaking

I guess many of the learner who want to acquire second language want to be a good speaker eventually. But I think this is a really tough point because it is effected by other kind of condition. 

For example:
- The personality who can accept any mistakes. 
- The personality who can keep trying with thinking. 
- The situation which allow to practice.
- The environment which allow to concentrate.
and so on.

If you are living in alone, my suggestion is to say a laud your opinion or your thinking anytime, during your staying your home. Anything is okay. The impression toward TV show, the impression toward the dinner. Also, you can choose any kind of topics now you are enjoying, similar like real conversation with your friend. 

I didn't know about this article, but I found one same opinion on the website. -> [IELTS スピーキング 8.5の非帰国子女の英語勉強法がヤバい件](http://matome.naver.jp/odai/2140092389738508601). So this must be effective way. Why not try?

And if you need, you can record its speaking by yourself, and you can check you speaking tone, accent, and speed anytime. Then you can recognize good point and bad point if only you already have a basic skill of listening. 

Anyway, there must be no shortest path to be a fluent. To find a every-day's trying is essential. To keep motivated is the vital for your achievement.
