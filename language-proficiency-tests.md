#Language Proficiency tests

Now TOEIC must be most popular test among Japan to certificate the skill of English. I think it is depending on the purpose how we can use it. If, we are some job seeker, to decorate our resume, to use these examination is a kind of useful tool. Other cases, because it is very clear indicator so just to take a test also a kind of fun. 

Eventually, it will be depending on the situation so the following is just a my case. 


## In my case

I took a TOEIC examination once in China, with Chinese student. The purpose is just for fun, and just wanted to indicate my current level of English after getting used to live in Shanghai. As the result I could get very basic requirement point which is indicated with overseas worker. 

Also there are similar certification which is hosted in Japan. -> [Casec](http://global.casec.com/). 

If you just want to quick try, this is also reasonable. 


### TOEIC

Because some person is trying so hard to achive a good score in TOEIC, I also want to think about this topic more deeply by myself.

My stances toward TOEIC, and kind of certification. 


### HSK

Also I tried HSK which is called [Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanyu_Shuiping_Kaoshi).
