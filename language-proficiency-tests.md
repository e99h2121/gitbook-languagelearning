#Language Proficiency tests

## TOEIC

Because some person is trying so hard to achive a good score in TOEIC, I also want to think about this topic more deeply by myself.

My stances toward TOEIC, and kind of certification. 


## HSK

Also I tried HSK which is called [Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanyu_Shuiping_Kaoshi).




## In my case

Also there are similar certification which is hosted in Japan. -> [Casec](http://global.casec.com/). 

If you just want to quick try for your fun, this is also reasonable.
