#Language Proficiency tests

Now TOEIC must be most popular test among Japan to certificate the skill of English. I think it is depending on the purpose how we can use it. If, we are some job seeker, to decorate our resume, to use these examination is a kind of useful tool. Other cases, because it is very clear indicator so just to take a test also a kind of fun. 


## In my case

Also there are similar certification which is hosted in Japan. -> [Casec](http://global.casec.com/). 

If you just want to quick try for your fun, this is also reasonable. 


### TOEIC

Because some person is trying so hard to achive a good score in TOEIC, I also want to think about this topic more deeply by myself.

My stances toward TOEIC, and kind of certification. 


### HSK

Also I tried HSK which is called [Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanyu_Shuiping_Kaoshi).
