#Pronunciation

My stances toward English pronunciation, especially as Japanese.

Simply, it is eventually not a first requirement. But still it is one of the important element for the indication of English skill. So we should not completely ignore, and if you want to be more higher level of speaker, it is a necessity. 

Here is one of the good tool -> [発音練習くん・声調確認くん](https://www2.nhk.or.jp/gogaku/hatsuon/)

## In my case

My stance is as written above. 

But when I'm working in Shanghai, I don't feel so much need toward the English pronunciation. I think it is because we workmate are non-native English speaker, and we are supplying the understanding each other. 

But when we think about usual Japanese person's viewpoint, good English pronunciation is highly respected. And sometimes it is regarded that the person who can pronounce English very well = Good English Speaker. There may be such a reputation. 






#Learn two kind of language at the same time

The experience to learn two kind of language at the same time. Especially about English and Chinese.

## In my case




#Mother language

If we cannot tell it effectively in Mother language, it is originally impossible to tell it in any language.

The word which is come from the bottom of my heart must be expressed in Japanese. I cannot change this opinion. 


## In my case

I studied fundamental logical writing, and logical thinking in technical writing. 



#Body language

Eventually, what is the communication.

Some article says, Japanese makes sometimes unreasonable smile when we feel some uncomfortable situation. And it looks mysterious or even confusing especially for westerner when they cannot get the context about it.

There are some article about scientific view point. see -> "Japanese smile  meaning" on google.



## In my case

But at least, to show the response toward presenter or speaker in front of us will be the basic manner and welcomed reaction with them. I tend to try to say something or asking question, if there are not any reaction from audience in the meeting. And even if we don't have much confidence in fluency of speaking, to show the reaction of positive/negative at least will be one kind of sign which should be accepted by speaker. 







#Biological understanding 

As the human's brain, to keep improving the skill of language requires some understanding of the biological structure. With thinking about 4 kinds of skills of the communication. 


- [Broca's area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broca%27s_area) -> It controls to produce speech. 

- [Wernicke's area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wernicke%27s_area) -> It controls to understand speech.

[Broca's area vs Wernicke's area](https://askwonder.com/q/brocas-area-vs-wernickes-area-55392b58ed1d710800d80a00)

And in the language skill there are 4 kind of factor. It is Speaking, Writing, Listening and Reading. The former 2 kinds are come from Broca's area and latter are come from Wernicke's area so the area which is used is different. So, to practice with thinking it's balance will be required.
